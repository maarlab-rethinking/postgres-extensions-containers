[TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) is an open-source
time-series database built on PostgreSQL. It enables fast analytics, efficient
storage, and powerful querying for time-series workloads.

This image provides a convenient way to deploy and manage the open-source core
of TimescaleDB with [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/).

## Usage

### 1. Add the TimescaleDB extension image to your Cluster

Define the `timescaledb-oss` extension under the `postgresql.extensions` section
of your `Cluster` resource. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-timescaledb
spec:
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-trixie
  instances: 1

  storage:
    size: 1Gi

  postgresql:
    shared_preload_libraries:
      - "timescaledb"
    parameters:
      timescaledb.telemetry_level: 'off'
      max_locks_per_transaction: '128'

    extensions:
    - name: timescaledb-oss
      image:
        # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-timescaledb
        reference: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/timescaledb-oss:2.30.1-18-trixie
```

### 2. Enable the extension in a database

You can install `timescaledb` in a specific database by creating or updating a
`Database` resource. For example, to enable it in the `app` database:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: cluster-timescaledb-app
spec:
  name: app
  owner: app
  cluster:
    name: cluster-timescaledb
  extensions:
  - name: timescaledb
    # renovate: suite=trixie-pgdg depName=postgresql-18-timescaledb extractVersion=^(?<version>\d+\.\d+\.\d+)
    version: '2.30.1'
```

### 3. Verify installation

Once the database is ready, connect to it with `psql` and run:

```sql
\dx
```

You should see `timescaledb` listed among the installed extensions.

### 4. Create a hypertable

To use TimescaleDB's time-series features, create a hypertable:

```sql
-- Create a regular table
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  sensor_id INTEGER,
  temperature DOUBLE PRECISION,
  humidity DOUBLE PRECISION
);

-- Convert it to a hypertable
SELECT create_hypertable('sensor_data', 'time');

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO sensor_data VALUES (NOW(), 1, 21.5, 45.0);
```
